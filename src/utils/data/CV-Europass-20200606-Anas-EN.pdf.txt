organisational / managerial skills _ projects
= final year project
hardware failure
detection in large
datacenters
(big data ml, pandas,
rapids, scikit-learn,
pycharm, tableau)
predictive model for hard drives failure in
data centers that minimize the effect of
disk failures and allow for more efficient
scheduled maintenance processes in
place of the inefficient reactive repair
procedures
social network
analysis using spark
(pagerank, connected
component, triangle
counting, spark)
describes an annotated graph-based
representation for social networks.
approach uses graph feature analysis to
recommend links, given structural
features of individual vertices and joint
features of the start and end points of a
candidate link.

reinforcement
learning
(ml, python, spyder)
demonstrates that the practical task of
routing packets through a network is a
natural application for reinforcement
learning algorithms, by simulating the
packet routing in a grid/ maze like
topology where the topology can be
changed to observe the change in routing
sentiment analysis
using word
semantics
(mapreduce, java)
sentiment analysis of shakespeare's
plays using word semantics to count up
the positive words and negative words in
the dataset, then dividing the difference
by the sum to calculate an overall
sentiment score for the text.
real-time trend
analysis using spark
(spark streaming,
python, apache kafka)
detecting real-time trending topics on
wikipedia using apache kafka as a
message queue and apache spark
streaming engine to perform the
analytics.
exploratory data
analysis on
wikipedia
(python, apache spark)
exploration of various wikipedia datasets
while applying the machine learning and
analytics techniques to get meaningful
insights from the data.
